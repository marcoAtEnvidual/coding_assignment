## Notes

I left comments in the code that otherwise would not be there to better understand my reasoning and what I would have done next if this were to be a bigger project.

I was a bit uncertain on what you meant by 'use git'. So I created my usual branches (master, developer) and one feature branch because dividing this simple project into subtasks would have been overkill. For bigger projects and especially with more than just me as a developer I would have done so.
